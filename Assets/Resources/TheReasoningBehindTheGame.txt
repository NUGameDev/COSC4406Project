Dealing with asthma can be challenging and damage the sufferer's self-esteem, especially when they are a kid. 
The motivation behind this game was to teach kids with asthma how to be aware of their limitations and pay attention 
to situations that can lead to an asthma flare up. This game aims to teach and empower these kids in a relatable and 
fun way.
